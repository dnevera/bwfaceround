# BWFace project's README

This is another look and feel implementation of BWFace. Most of digital-style watch faces offer a lot of functionality, as well as a huge amount of information presents on a screen. As a result of these, data from their screens can be read with difficulty by people who have limited vision capabilities like me. This watch face allows to read the key personal metrics quick and consciously.

On the other hand the main idea of the watch face design is to have ability read on the screen difference between BMR (https://goo.gl/yZwN7J) and your current burned calories.

I call the feature "Differential BMR Meter". The "Meter" consists of circle and one value shows difference between your basal metabolic rate and the calories for the day. During a day circle changes their state: length of part arc is decreasing or growing. The colored arc shows of unused of your calories in percents relative to the BMR. The another colored arc gives you to understand: you've already spent more than your BMR but you are not activity enough to burn the fat. The color highlighted arc shows how much calories was burnt beyond your BMR. At the end of a day you can see estimated value of your activity factor: the longer highlighted arc means the best calories burning result. This one can motivate you to enforce additional activities (to lost weight or body fat burn).

The next thing can help you control your burning calories activity is "activity factor" (AF). If your AF is more than 1.5 of BMR you do good training. The watch face contains bar-graph has 8 AF bars: last 7th days + today. Green (or white) bars show well-trained day, orange (or grey) means your day is good, red (or dark grey) bars shows that on the contrary: you missed the days. A line on the graph gives a view of an average value if AF for the last 8 days. The green line means your week workouts had good activity, red means your should make some efforts and increase your activity. Color of bars depend on chosen Color Scheme.

User settings allow to change colors scheme of accents: black, white and "fruit".

The current version presents standard digital watch with week day/month day/sunrise/sunset fields.

You can customize what metrics you want to see on the screen :

1. Seconds*

2. Daily steps

3. Daily distance

4. Burned calories

5. Altitude*

6. Heart rate*

7. Atmospheric pressure in kPa/hPa/mmHg*

8. Temperature*

9. Basal metabolic rate

10. Phone connection status

11. Activity Factor of BMR

12. Elevation

13. Floors climbed

14. Activity factor history bar-graph

15. Speed/Cadence in active mode (any training app is launched)

* - for devices that support it

Also you can configure to show some system statuses: battery usage, phone connection or notification icons.

NOTES:

1. Don't forget check configuration of wrist/external heart rate sensor to enable HR field.

2. After the first update, to make "Sunrise"/"Sunset" available you should launch an app of any outdoor activity like "Walking"/"Running" and wait for connection of GPS/GLONASS.

3. Don't forget change your personal Profile every time when your weight is changing to make measurements of your BMR accuracy.

4. Some fields (like seconds, pressure, floors climbed, etc.) availability depends on w.face hardware model. For example, fenix 3 does not support floors climbed field.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a settings issue after update, please restart your watches.
